# Change Log

## Version 0.7.0

### Highlights

This release exports all functions in `matplotlib.pyplot` to `latexplotlib`. This means you can use `lpl` as a drop-in replacement for `plt`and you don't have to import `matplotlib.pyplot` if you import latexplotlib. Also there is finally a changelog ðŸŽ‰
